This a example of a RAT using a discord webhook that we can make in python, it will firstly steal ur ip and locate it, then proceed to know more about your system and then steal your data from your navigators directory. And then after collecting and sending it to your discord Webhook, the files will be deleted automaticly from the pc of the victim. This is just a basic RAT to let u understand how a RAT work, and not to use it against someone else without his authorization.

THIS CODE SHOULD HELP U TO UNDERSTAND HOW A RAT WORK. SO DONT BE A SKID AND USING IT ON SOMEONE ELSE. 

I DONT TAKE RESPONSBLITY OF UR ACTS.
